# Healthcare-DataAnalysis-Patient-Appointment-Management
The objective is to analyze patient appointment data to improve scheduling efficiency and reduce missed appointments.
This project analyzes patient appointment data to uncover patterns in attendance, cancellations, and scheduling efficiency. The objective is to provide actionable insights that can help healthcare providers optimize appointment management and improve patient care delivery.
- Tools and Techniques used;
- SQL: Used to query dataset to extract relevant insights.
- Excel: Data cleaning, Applied advanced formulas and pivot tables for trend analysis.
- Power BI: Created an interactive dashboard with drill-down capabilities to visualize attendance trends, and scheduling efficiency.
- Insight;
- The General Surgery department has the highest number of patients (112), closely followed by pediatrics (109). This indicates that these departments face higher demand compared to others. Additionally, eczema and Hypertension are among the most diagnosed conditions, suggesting specific areas of frequent care.
- Morning appointments have the highest attendance rate across all departments, while evening slots see the most missed appointments. This indicates patient preference for morning appointments, possibly due to convenience or scheduling compatibility.
- Recommendations;
- Prioritize resource allocation (e.g., staff, appointment slots) in high-demand departments like General Surgery and pediatrics to manage patient flow more efficiently. Implement targeted patient education and treatment programs for common conditions like eczema and Hypertension to improve care outcomes and reduce repeat visits.
- Shift more appointment slots to the morning and early afternoon to align with patient preferences and reduce missed appointments. Additionally, implement a reminder system for evening and appointments to improve attendance rates.
